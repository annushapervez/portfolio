summary: "A decentralized peer-to-peer network implementation utilizing the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT) protocol to enable efficient data storage and retrieval across a distributed network"
---

## Overview

The Kademlia project is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that uses a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) protocol to locate and store data efficiently. Designed for scalability and fault tolerance, Kademlia enables nodes to communicate and exchange data within a decentralized network structure, without relying on a central authority. By implementing the Kademlia protocol, this project ensures data redundancy, fast lookups, and secure peer-to-peer communications, making it a suitable solution for large-scale distributed systems, blockchain networks, and decentralized storage applications.

## Project Goals

- **Implement the Kademlia DHT protocol** to enable decentralized data storage and retrieval.
- **Create an efficient lookup mechanism** that allows nodes to find data across the network with minimal overhead.
- **Ensure fault tolerance and redundancy** by distributing data across multiple nodes.
- **Optimize network performance** by implementing efficient routing, based on XOR distance.
- **Provide secure peer-to-peer communication** between nodes in the network.

## Tech Stack

### Backend:
- **Go**: For implementing the Kademlia protocol and server logic.
- **HTTP and RPC**: For node-to-node communication.
- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**: For efficient serialization and deserialization of messages between nodes.

### Database:
- **In-memory storage** or a simple key-value store for rapid data access and testing.

### Testing:
- **Unit Testing Framework**: Goâ€™s built-in testing package.
- **Integration Testing**: Custom test cases to validate data lookup, routing, and fault tolerance under network partitions and failures.

## Features

- **Peer Discovery**: Automatically finds new peers to join the network, maintaining an updated list of active nodes.
- **Efficient Routing**: Uses XOR-based distance metrics to locate nodes close to the data, ensuring low-latency lookups.
- **Data Redundancy**: Stores data across multiple nodes for improved fault tolerance and data availability.
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypts data transfer between nodes to protect against data interception and tampering.
- **Self-Healing Network**: Rebuilds and redistributes data when nodes leave or fail, ensuring data persistence.

## Configuration

### Node Setup
Each node in the network is configured with:

- **Unique Node ID**: Generated at node startup to uniquely identify each peer.
- **Routing Table**: Maintains a list of known peers sorted by XOR distance for optimized routing.
- **Bootstrap Nodes**: Initial set of peers to join the network; nodes use these to discover further peers.
- **Data Storage**: Key-value store for data items, allowing for fast access and updates.

### Protocol Parameters

- **K-Bucket Size**: Defines the maximum number of nodes that can be stored at each distance bucket, optimizing for fault tolerance.
- **Timeout Settings**: Determines how long a node should wait for a response before marking it as failed.
- **Refresh Interval**: Nodes periodically refresh their buckets to maintain connectivity and ensure data availability.

## Testing and Validation

To validate functionality and robustness:

- **Unit Tests**: Each function, including routing, storage, and peer discovery, is rigorously tested.
- **Integration Tests**: Simulates network scenarios such as node failures and network partitions.
- **Performance Testing**: Measures lookup and storage latency under various network sizes and loads.
- **Security Testing**: Ensures data integrity and peer authentication by testing encrypted communication and handling unauthorized access attempts.
