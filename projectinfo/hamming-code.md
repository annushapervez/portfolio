summary: "A MIPS assembly subroutine for 7-bit Hamming codes to handle error detection, correction, and data encoding with a user-friendly menu system."
---

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of a MIPS subroutine that implements error detection and correction using 7-bit Hamming codes. It allows users to input a Hamming code, check for single-bit errors, and retrieve the original 4-bit data word. Additionally, users can input 4-bit data and generate a 7-bit Hamming code. The subroutine is designed with separate functions for each operation, enhancing modularity and ensuring that the program avoids pseudo-instructions for optimized performance within MIPS architecture.

## What is a Hamming Code?
A Hamming code is a type of error-correcting code used in digital communication and data storage. Developed by Richard Hamming, it is designed to detect and correct single-bit errors in data transmissions, which helps ensure data integrity.

In a 7-bit Hamming code, 4 bits contain the actual data (called the data bits), while the remaining 3 bits are parity bits. These parity bits are strategically placed within the code to check combinations of data bits, forming a structure that can identify errors. When a single-bit error occurs, the parity bits help determine the exact position of the error, allowing it to be corrected. This makes Hamming codes especially useful in situations where data reliability is crucial, such as in computer memory, data storage, and network transmissions.
